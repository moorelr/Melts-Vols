This program uses a MELTS output file to draw a cumulative mineral volume figure. To use, copy the melts.out file into the folder, and run the draw plots.R script. This can be done either with the included .bat file (as long as rscript.exe is in the system path variable) or by running the .R script in RStudio or terminal.

This program was written for use in Windows, but will probably work for Linux and Mac users also (not tested!)
